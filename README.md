# TechZ
## Introduction
TechZ is an electronics e-commerce website developed by me and a friend. The project is entirely built using PHP following the MVC model. We have completed the admin panel, which allows for managing user-related data. Users can access the website and place orders for displayed products in the shop. When an order is successfully placed, they will receive a confirmation email from us.

### Register and login 
To access the extended features of the website, we need to register a user account. After that, log in to the account.

### Order
After creating an account, users can search for products by category, search by name, and filter by price. Once they have selected their desired product, they can add it to the cart.
